PH = PH Scale of water.
HARDNESS = the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water
SOLIDS = dissolved solids plus suspended and settleable solids in water
CHLORAMINES = the process of adding chloramine to drinking water to disinfect it and kill germs.
SULFATE = Sulfate levels above 250 mg/L may make the water taste bitter or like medicine.
CONFUCTIVITY =  Conductivity is useful as a general measure of water quality.(SEA WATER,RAIN WATER,DRINKING WATER)
ORGANIC CARBON = the amount carbon atoms tied up in organic compounds in a water sample.
THMS=Trihalomethanes as an important group of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are formed by the reaction of chlorine with natural organic matter exists in water supplies. 
TURBIDITY = Turbidity is the measure of relative clarity of a liquid.
POTABILITY = It is a water that can use for Drinking and Cooking Purpose.
